# In this scenario
# the vehicle is driving in a straigt road with one other vehicle at the front
# (1) speed of vehicle below (cogmod) is more than vehicle at front
# (2) spawn distance between vehicles needs to be more than the trigger distance
# (3) both the vehicle accelerate to reach the target speed
# (4) if the distance becomes less than the trigger distance before
#     vehicle reaching target speed, we stop simulation
# (5) if both the vehicle reaches the target speed and the distance is more than the trigger distance,
#     we treat that as a valid simulation
# (6) if simulation is valid and the distance is less than the trigger distance
#     vehicle at front brake and come to stop
